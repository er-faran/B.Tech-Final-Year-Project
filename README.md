### Introduction

In this project, we will interface the Gas sensor with Arduino. Simply we will design Fire Detector using Gas Sensor and Arduino for detecting fire. The project fire alarm or fire detector using Gas sensor and Arduino is a wonderful project.

Gas detector sensor usually employ an audible alarm to alert people when dangerous fire has been detected. 

### Aim

Our aim is to make a very accurate and cheap Fire Alarm which gives to the precious readings and alert the user when Fire has been detected.

### Components

- ARDUINO

  Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.Â Arduino are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button , and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.


- GAS SENSOR

  AÂ gas sensorÂ is a device which detects the presence or concentration ofÂ gasesÂ in the atmosphere. Based on the concentration of theÂ gasÂ theÂ sensorÂ produces a corresponding potential difference by changing the resistance of the material inside theÂ sensor, which can be measured as output voltage.

- BUZZER

  A Buzzer is an audio signaling device. When the fire is detected by the fire sensor then fire sensor indicates to Arduino , then Arduino send the signal to buzzer , At the end Buzzer indicates people.

- LED

  LED Fire Alarm alert and warning you and your family far away from the danger of fire.

- BLUETOOTH MODULE

### Advantages

- Sensing of fire easily
- Simple Circuit
- Low Power consumption
- Low cost

### Disadvantages

- No Longer Use
- Senses near by fire only
- Use continuous power supply

### Application

- Home Security System
- School & College Labs
- Industries 
- Etc.
