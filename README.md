## Descriptions

### Introduction

In this project, we will interface the Gas sensor with Arduino. Simply we will design Fire Detector using Gas Sensor and Arduino for detecting fire. The project fire alarm or fire detector using Gas sensor and Arduino is a wonderful project.

Gas detector sensor usually employ an audible alarm to alert people when dangerous fire has been detected. 

### Aim

Our aim is to make a very accurate and cheap Fire Alarm which gives to the precious readings and alert the user when Fire has been detected.
